            Edward Joseph Snowden (born June 21, 1983) is an American
            whistleblower who copied and leaked highly classified information
            from the National Security Agency (NSA) in 2013 when he was a
            Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee and subcontractor. His
            disclosures revealed numerous global surveillance programs, many run
            by the NSA and the Five Eyes Intelligence Alliance with the
            cooperation of telecommunication companies and European governments,
            and prompted a cultural discussion about national security and
            individual privacy.
          </li>
          <li class="li">
            In 2013, Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor, Booz Allen
            Hamilton, after previous employment with Dell and the CIA. Snowden
            says he gradually became disillusioned with the programs with which
            he was involved and that he tried to raise his ethical concerns
            through internal channels but was ignored. On May 20, 2013, Snowden
            flew to Hong Kong after leaving his job at an NSA facility in
            Hawaii, and in early June he revealed thousands of classified NSA
            documents to journalists Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras, Barton
            Gellman, and Ewen MacAskill. Snowden came to international attention
            after stories based on the material appeared in The Guardian, The
            Washington Post, and other publications.
          </li>
          <li class="li">
            On June 21, 2013, the United States Department of Justice unsealed
            charges against Snowden of two counts of violating the Espionage Act
            of 1917 and theft of government property, following which the
            Department of State revoked his passport. Two days later, he flew
            into Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport, where Russian
            authorities observed the cancelled passport, and he was restricted
            to the airport terminal for over one month. Russia later granted
            Snowden the right of asylum with an initial visa for residence for
            one year, which was subsequently repeatedly extended. In October
            2020, he was granted permanent residency in Russia.
          </li>
          <li class="li">
            A subject of controversy, Snowden has been variously called a
            traitor, a hero, a whistleblower, a dissident, and a patriot. U.S.
            officials condemned his actions as having done "grave damage" to the
            U.S. intelligence capabilities. Snowden has defended his leaks as an
            effort "to inform the public as to that which is done in their name
            and that which is done against them." His disclosures have fueled
            debates over mass surveillance, government secrecy, and the balance
            between national security and information privacy.
          </li>
          <li class="li">
            In early 2016, Snowden became the president of the Freedom of the
            Press Foundation, a San Francisco-based nonprofit organization that
            aims to protect journalists from hacking and government
            surveillance. In 2017, he married Lindsay Mills. On September 17,
            2019, his memoir Permanent Record was published. On September 2,
            2020, a U.S. federal court ruled that the U.S. intelligence’s mass
            surveillance program, exposed by Edward Snowden, was illegal and
            possibly unconstitutional.
